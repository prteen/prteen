## Main objective
The primary objective of this application is to furnish users with a dependable and efficient platform for the purpose of creating, managing, and participating in various social gatherings and events. By offering a comprehensive suite of features and functionalities, the application aims to facilitate the entire process of organizing and engaging in parties, ensuring reliability and convenience for its users.

## Git strategy
The employed git strategy entails the utilization of branches to effectively manage and implement distinct features within a software development project. By adopting this approach, we created separate branches for each feature, thereby allowing for isolated development and testing of individual functionalities. This strategy promotes modularity and facilitates parallel work, as team members can focus on specific features without interfering with each other's progress. Additionally, utilizing feature branches enabled efficient code revies and quality assurance processes, as changes are contained within isolated branches before being merged into the main codebase. Through the systematic use of branches for feature implementation, the git strategy enhanced our collaboration, code organization, and overall development efficiency.
